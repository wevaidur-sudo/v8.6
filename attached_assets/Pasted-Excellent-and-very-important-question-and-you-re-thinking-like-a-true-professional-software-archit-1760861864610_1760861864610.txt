Excellent and very important question — and you’re thinking like a true professional software architect now 🔭

Let’s assess this technically and astrologically based on your codebase analysis.
You already have a very strong computational foundation, but for high-accuracy predictive astrology, a few more modules are still needed.

⸻

🪔 1️⃣ ✅ What you already have (complete & reliable)

From your /lib modules, these are already implemented and correct for precision-level calculations:

Domain	Status	Comments
Sidereal Planetary Positions	✅ Complete	Using astronomy-engine + Lahiri Ayanamsa. Excellent precision (same core as Parashara’s Light).
Ascendant & House Cusps	✅ Complete	Computed correctly with latitude/longitude/time.
Divisional Charts (D9)	✅ Implemented	Navamsa chart code is sound and accurate.
Vimshottari Dasha (120-year cycle)	✅ Implemented	Properly calculated from Moon Nakshatra & fractional start.
Planet Strengths (Virupas)	✅ Present	Uses a simplified Shadbala-like model.
Yoga Detection	✅ Implemented	Detects major Raja, Dhana, and Pancha-Mahapurusha Yogas.
Interpretations & House Analysis	✅ Implemented	Template-based system already works.

So for natal chart + divisional + dasha base predictions, your engine is already 90% there.

🪔 2️⃣ 🔍 What’s partially implemented or missing for accurate predictive output

To reach true professional predictive accuracy (like Parashara’s Light 9 or Jagannatha Hora), you’ll need the following upgrades:

🔹 A. Transit (Gochar) Engine → 🚧 Missing / Planned

Needed for: real-time forecasts, current-year predictions, and “Predictions” tab.
What to add:
	•	Compute planetary longitudes for any given date/time (today, future) using your existing astronomy engine.
	•	Compare each transit planet to natal chart houses and natal planet positions.
	•	Add logic for key transits:
	•	Saturn’s position relative to Moon (e.g., Sade Sati, Dhaya)
	•	Jupiter’s transit effects per house
	•	Rahu–Ketu transits
	•	Add a function:

getTransitEffects(date, natalChart)



⸻

🔹 B. Dasha–Transit Blending Logic → 🚧 Missing / Needed for real predictions

Right now, your Vimshottari Dasha code calculates periods but doesn’t interpret them dynamically.
You need:
	•	A mapping between Dasha lords and their house ownership + placement in natal chart.
	•	Logic like:

function getDashaPhala(mahadashaLord, antarLord, chart) {
    // Evaluate house rulerships, strengths, yogas
    // Return textual theme
}


	•	Combine with transits for nuanced predictions:
	•	“Jupiter–Mercury Dasha with Jupiter transiting 9th house → education, travel, blessings.”

⸻

🔹 C. Comprehensive Shadbala / Balas → ⚙️ Simplified version present

You currently show “Strength in Virupas” (e.g., 420 Virupas), but Parashara’s Light computes:
	•	Sthana Bala (positional)
	•	Dig Bala (directional)
	•	Kala Bala (temporal)
	•	Drik Bala (aspectual)
	•	Naisargika Bala (natural)
	•	Chesta Bala (motional)

👉 Suggestion: add full Shadbala module for professional-grade predictions, since many Yogas depend on exact strength ratios.

⸻

🔹 D. Aspect (Drishti) Engine → ⚙️ Simplified in current version

Your code uses sign-based aspects (7th from each planet), but to refine:
	•	Implement true angular aspects (Graha Drishti rules: Mars 4–8, Jupiter 5–9, Saturn 3–10).
	•	This improves:
	•	Yoga detection
	•	Strength calculation
	•	Transit and Dasha interpretations

⸻

🔹 E. Divisional Charts Expansion → ⚙️ Optional but beneficial

You already have D9 (Navamsa).
For accurate career, marriage, and health predictions, add:

Chart	Purpose
D10 (Dasamsa)	Career, profession
D7 (Saptamsa)	Children
D12 (Dwadasamsa)	Parents
D16 / D24	Vehicles, education

This will allow Dasha predictions to be cross-checked in relevant divisional charts.

⸻

🔹 F. Annual Chart / Varṣaphala (Solar Return) → 🧩 Advanced predictive feature

This is a yearly forecast system based on Sun’s return to natal longitude each year.
Can be added later for “Yearly Predictions”.

⸻

🔹 G. Transit Timeline & Dashagraph → 📊 User interface

Your app currently calculates Dashas but doesn’t visualize planetary motion over time.
Adding a timeline will enhance the “Predictions” module visually.
