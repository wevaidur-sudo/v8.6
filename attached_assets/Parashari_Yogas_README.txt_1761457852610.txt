DATA ACCURACY NOTES:
===================
- All yoga formations have been cross-referenced with classical texts
- Formation rules are stated in plain language suitable for programming logic
- Effects are summarized from traditional sources
- Chapter and verse references provided where available from BPHS
- This list focuses on Parāśarī system yogas (not Jaimini or Tajika yogas)

PROGRAMMING IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
================================
1. Check planetary positions using exact degrees, not just signs
2. Verify house lordships based on ascendant (Lagna)
3. Calculate mutual aspects using Parāśarī or Jaimini aspect rules
4. Consider both Rasi (D1) chart and divisional charts (especially D9 Navamsa)
5. Evaluate planetary strength (Shadbala) before assigning yoga results
6. Check for yoga cancellation factors (bhanga)
7. Time yoga results using Vimshottari Dasha periods

FILE STRUCTURE:

The CSV file contains the following columns:
1. Yoga Name (Sanskrit) - Original Sanskrit name
2. Yoga Name (English) - English translation/transliteration
3. Category - Classification of yoga type
4. Formation Rules - Specific planetary/house combinations
5. Effects/Results - Traditional results of the yoga

RECOMMENDED USAGE:
=================
1. Import CSV into your astrology software database
2. Parse formation rules to create conditional logic
3. Cross-reference with planetary dignities and strengths
4. Generate automated yoga reports for birth charts
5. Verify yoga presence through manual calculation for critical cases
6. Consider yoga strength gradations (weak/moderate/strong)

LIMITATIONS & DISCLAIMERS:
=========================
- Not all yogas are of equal strength or importance
- Some yogas are very common (e.g., simple Gajakesari) vs very rare
- Classical texts sometimes give variant definitions
- Results manifest based on overall chart strength and Dasha periods
- Professional astrologers should use judgment alongside automated detection
- This is a foundational list; many more specific yogas exist in literature
