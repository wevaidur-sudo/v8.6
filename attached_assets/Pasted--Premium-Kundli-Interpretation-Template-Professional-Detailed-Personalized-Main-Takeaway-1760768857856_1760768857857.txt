The influence of Venus on the 10th house brings potential for work in luxury, design, or partnerships. The dasha of Saturn-Mercury starting October 2027 will boost your networking and intellectual growth—ideal for a major career move or further studies in management or technology.

**Recommended Actions:** Focus on disciplined effort, consider professional certification in next 1–2 years. Avoid major job changes during adverse Mars antardasha periods.
